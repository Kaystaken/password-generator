# password-generator

## Description

### Motivation

An employee with access to sensitive data needed a randomly generated password

### Why?

Allows you to pick the criteria you'd like to include for extra security and to meet requirements of various sites

### Problem Solved

Now they can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Learnings

I learned some basics of JavaScript. The var is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable. Semicolons are used to seperate or end statements. Prompt instructs the browser to display my message prompting the user to input some text and confirm is used to diplay a question to confirm with user. ParseInt has its own return and is its own function.
